=================

animationExample.py
    An example of a graphical animation

CensusTownAndCityPopulation.csv
    A csv file which will be needed for homework 3

ccHistStuff.py
   Utilities for histogram plotting.  At the moment implemented
   a stat box and putting error bars on a histogram.

colorPicture.py
  An example of making an 8 bit color pixel map

compareLogNormal.py
   A comparison of a Gaussian and a "massaged" Lognormal
   which looks very much like a Lognormal distribution
   except that the "massaged" Lognormal can never go
   negative.

dataSet.npy
    A dataset consisting of a 1D numpy array saved in numpy format.
    This is to be used for Exercise 1 in Homework Set 4.

demoGraph.py
    An example of how to plot points with error bars and lines

demoHist.py
    Lots of example of different types of histogram plottind,
    1D and 2D, also color maps (temperature plots)

demoReadFile.py
    Several ways of reading a text file

demoWriteFile.py
    How to write out stuff to a text file

exampleOfCommandInput.py
    Example of passing parameters and options to a python program
    from the command line

exampleOfZip.py
   zip is a useful way of aggregating iterables in a loop

genExponential.py
   Example of generating and plotting (on a log scale) an exponential

genPoisson.py
   Example of generating and plotting a Poisson distribution

markovChain.py
   Example of how to generate random numbers using a Markov Chain.
   In this case we have a hardwired Gaussian as our target pdf
   and a flat pdf as our proposal

muonSim.py
   Generated pp -> W -> mu nu decays and plot the transverse
   momentum of the muon.  The ideas behind this were discussed
   in class on Feb 4.  Slides with the discussion can be found on
   the class website

plotGaussian.py
   Plots of gaussian, error function, one sided p-value to N(sigma)

testOfImportanceSampling.py
   An example of MC integration with and without importance sampling

testFile.txt
  A random text file used by demoReadFile.py
