# A toy program to generate a sequence of random
# numbers distributed according to ANY probability
# distribution using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
#
# The probability distribution of interest is myPDF(x)
# It does not need to be normalized.
# It is hardcoded.  Easy to change.
#
# The user needs to supply a few things.
#
# First:
# A pdf that is used to move in the
# sequence of random numbers from x to y.
# This is the so called "proposal distribution" P(y|x).
# Note: this is NOT the probability of the 
# nth random number being y if the nth-1 is x.
# But it is related to it.....
# In principle P(y|x) can be ANY function as long as it
# is non-zero in the domain of validity of myPDF. 
# The proposal function is of the Metropolis type, ie,
# P(y|x) = P(x|y)
# It is hardcoded as proposal(x) and returns y
# Note that the returned value is still just a "proposal"
# so it can be accepted or rejected
#
# Second:
# An initial value of x.  
# It can be anything but it must have myPDF(x) > 0
# It probably makes sense for this to be somewhere in the bulk
# of the distribution of interest.
#
# Third: 
# The number of members of the chain to generate  (n)
#
# Fourth:
# The number of initial members of the chain to 
# ignore (the so called burn-in, nBurn)
#
# To visualize the chain, we fill a histogram of members of the chain.
# The parameters of the histogram are hardcoded.
