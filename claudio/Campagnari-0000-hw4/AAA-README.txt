Some solutions make use of the utility functions in ccHist.py.
This file is therefore included in the tgz file.
Similarly, the npy file is also included.

Exercise 1
--------
linux> ./plotDataset.py 

Exercise 2
--------
To get help
./genUncertainPoisson.py -h
To run the program that solves this problem for example
linux> ./genUncertainPoisson.py -m 2.3 -o 10 -u 2. -g

Exercise 3
--------
linux> ./mcIntegration.py 

Exercise 4
--------
linux> ./markovIntegration.py

Exercise 5
--------
linux> ./poissonPosterior.py
