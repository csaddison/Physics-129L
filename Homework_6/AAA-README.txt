# Homework 6

Exercise 1:
I presume you run LVector_specification.py?
The code for this exercise is saved in LVector.py
Currently multiplication doesnt seem invariant under boost, haven't pinpointed why yet

Exercise 2:
Run exercise2.py
Didn't know if we were supposed to normalie the pdf after calculating the integral
Added that but commented it out because it gave a really low value for the confidence interval. If it's required simply uncomment it
This prints the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval
The posterior pdf for N=5 and N=1 are saved at posterior_N5.png and posterior_N1.png

Exercise 3:
Run exercise3.py
Prints the answer to the terminal

Exercise 4:
Run exercise4.py
This produces a plot saved at psi.png
